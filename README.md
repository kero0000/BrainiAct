Summary: An Android application to support the elderly's  declining cognitive abilities and to keep track of their performance. We have 3 games - Trail Marking Test, Memory Game and 
          reaction speed test. We have a leaderboard feature to display an individual's performance compared to the cohort. In addition, there is a tracker function to display the individual's
            performance over a period of time(months) to determine any trending loss in cognitive abilities.
